BasicCauldronAdditions
======================

A bukkit plugin which adds functionality to cauldrons!

How to use
==========
To cast concrete you simply need a filled cauldron, right click on the cauldron (ensuring there is a block space between you and the cauldron) and out will pop a cast concrete block!

This will consume the water from the cauldron so you might want to form a infinite water source above the cauldron from which it will now refill.

To avoid blocks flying everywhere you can place a hopper under the cauldron and cast blocks will go into the hopper rather then on the floor keeping things nice and clean ;).

To cast obsidian you will need an empty cauldron which has water flowing over it (non-source blocks will not fill the cauldron). As before hoppers can be used to "catch" the cast blocks.
